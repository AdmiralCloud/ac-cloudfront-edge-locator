# AC Cloudfront Edge Locator
This tool displays the Cloudfront edge location from which the given domain is delivered.

AWS does not provide a list of IPs mapping to their edge locations. However, our team at AdmiralCloud required a tool to check from which location content of our media asset management is delivered.

Fortunately, AWS uses IATA airport codes for their edge locations, so we can use them.

# Usage
```
node index.js --domain api-ext.admiralcloud.com
```

# Installation
Install this tool using "npm install ac-cloudfront-edge-locator"
